\usage{
analyze_gene_fluctuation(seurat_obj, n_cores = NULL)

analyze_gene_fluctuation(seurat_obj, n_cores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_obj}{A Seurat object that has been processed by `run_coral_ground_truth_analysis`.}

\item{n_cores}{An integer specifying the number of cores to use for parallel processing.}
}
\value{
An updated Seurat object with fluctuation analysis results.

An updated Seurat object with fluctuation analysis results, including
the new `global_omega_area` value in the `misc` slot.
}
\description{
This version is highly optimized to avoid redundant computations.
It performs hierarchical clustering only once, then uses cutree() to
get all cluster assignments, leading to a massive speed improvement.

This version is highly optimized and calculates both the gene-specific
fluctuation area (`omega_area`) and the 'global_omega_area' based on the overall
clone distance hierarchy, replicating the logic from the original manuscript's script.
It performs hierarchical clustering only once, then uses cutree() to get all
cluster assignments, leading to a massive speed improvement.
