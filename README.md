# CORAL
CORAL(clone oriented reconstruction of attractors in the landscape) is a project for heritbale cell state identification and gene expression dynamics inference, mainly based on the lineage tracing strategy. 

## CORAL-base

CORAL-base is the original version of CORAL, designed for one timepoint lineage tracing dataset analysis. By integrating lineage information, it provides an alternative way to define the boundary of a really 'heritable' cell state, rather than a 'cluster'. Then the 'CORAL'-like cell state tree enables a systematic analysis of 'memory genes' participating in many biology process.
