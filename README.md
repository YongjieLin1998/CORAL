# CORAL
CORAL(clone oriented reconstruction of attractors in the landscape) is a project for heritbale cell state identification and gene expression dynamics inference, mainly based on the lineage tracing strategy. 

## CORAL-base

CORAL-base is the original version of CORAL, designed for one timepoint lineage tracing dataset analysis. By integrating lineage information, it provides an alternative way to define the boundary of a really 'heritable' cell state, rather than a 'cluster'. Then the 'CORAL'-like cell state tree enables a systematic analysis of 'memory genes' participating in many biology process. 

The original codes and example datasets of the [initial manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.21.671653v1.full) are available in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-cNiSKZFyVSs9Mndq87AcRXfaGweLesj?usp=sharing. 

User-friendly package and tutorial is coming soon.
